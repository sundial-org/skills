description: Conduct a literature review and develop a CS research proposal. Use when asked to review a research area, find gaps in existing work, and propose a novel research contribution. The output is a research proposal identifying an assumption to challenge (the "bit flip") and how to validate it.

# CS Research Methodology

Framework for investigating problems by identifying assumptions and proposing alternatives.

## Core Concept: The Bit Flip

Every research contribution follows this pattern:
1. **The Bit**: What does everyone assume?
2. **The Flip**: What's the alternative?
3. **The Proof**: Why does the alternative work better?

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Identify the Bit

What do existing approaches take for granted?
- What do all solutions have in common?
- What's implicit in how the problem is framed?

→ See [references/framing.md](references/framing.md) for process and examples.

### Step 2: Find Where It Fails

When does the assumption break down?
- Edge cases, new capabilities, adjacent fields solving it differently

→ See [references/landscape.md](references/landscape.md) for mapping approaches.

### Step 3: Propose the Flip

"Current approaches assume X. Instead, Y."
- Must be specific and testable
- Explain the mechanism

→ See [references/prioritization.md](references/prioritization.md) for focusing investigation.

### Step 4: Design the Proof

What evidence would be convincing?
- Match evaluation to claim type

→ See [references/validation.md](references/validation.md) for evaluation design.
